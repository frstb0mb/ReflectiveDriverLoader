# (Reflective) DriverLoader
DriverLoader can load some drivers with manual loading despite they have no code signing.  
This technique is same as Reflective DLL Loading.
SampleClient makes DriverLoader load SampleDriver, and it invokes ReadFile against a device of loaded.  
You must unload DriverLoader or use IOCTL_LOADER_UNLOAD to unload loaded driver.
